# SpaceX vs Blue Origin Design

SpaceX is emblematic of Musk companies' design. It's very Apple-esque in its approach and quality: clean, simple, elegant. So clean I can't even see a menu[^1]. The hero is just a simple beautiful picture (that turns into a video once properly loaded):

To really see it, it's worth comparing SpaceX to Blue Origin. Blue Origin  is, of course, Bezos' venture. This makes this a very Apple to Amazon/Microsoft comparison. Amazon is all competence, low-cost, "no bells and whistles". Apple is all quality, design, sleekness. You can see this in the websites.

## Commentary

- Blue Origin top menu is kind of clunky by comparison
- SpaceX is just simple picture + small text
- SpaceX footer is literally 2 unimportant links (and bottom of page is mission)

- Compare Blue Origin whose footer is massive - a whole section in itself.

- SpaceX mission statement is crunchy: "Make Life Interplanetary" whereas Blue Origin is PoMo empty purpose BS "For the Benefit of Earth" (what does that mean? who is Earth??)
- SpaceX is stark, clean, stripped down. We're in space.

## Here's some Tesla.com

Look at how simple the Hero section is. Just one image. One statement. Two calls to action which are super clear.
