Thoughts on UX patterns and collection of such patterns.

# UX Patterns

## 1. Images for everything

Humans like and respond to images, and especially faces (babies as young as few days pay more attention to images containing of human faces than other kinds of image)

* Use (gr)avatars
* For any object you have, try to have an image ...
* favicon

## 2. Dashboards

Dashboards are good. Every app should have a dashboard.

## 3. User centric structure (and urls)

     http://site.com/{user-name}/...

Examples:

* twitter
* github

## 4. Search *everywhere*

Get rid of browse or list and replace with search

## 5. Everything has a title and a 'slug'

Everything has:

* id (+name/slug) -> use it for the URL
* label/title -> use it in the interface

## Modals

* - only one at a time
* + do not need to interfere with main page
