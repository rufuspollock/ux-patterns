This is a list of themes that I have liked.

# Bootstrap

Lists

* http://www.blacktie.co/ - about a dozen open-source fully designed themes
* 63 good bootstrap themes - http://www.templatemag.com/free-bootstrap-templates/ (my favaourites from this list are already below)
* http://bootstrapzero.com/ - listing of open-source bootstrap themes

Themes

* Solid - http://www.blacktie.co/demo/solid/ - a bit blocky for my tastes 6/10
* Munter - http://www.blacktie.co/demo/munter/ - single page - 8/10
* Pratt - http://www.blacktie.co/demo/pratt/ - app landing page - 7/10
* Bolt - http://www.blacktie.co/demo/bolt/ - pretty lean and clean - 7.5/10
* Essentia - http://essentia.bootstrapmaster.com/ - very clean - 6-8/10
* CleanBlog - http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog/ - simple (medium-style) blog theme
* Journal - http://bootswatch.com/journal/ - very basic tweaking. like the colours but not the typography
 
#Â Jekyll

See http://jekyllthemes.org/

This is selection from https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes

Some of these are also bootstrap

* http://incorporated.sendtoinc.com/ - very nice, clean, 1 page suitable for general websites (not blog)
* http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-freelancer/ - freelancer (also a plain bootstrap i think)
* http://jekyll.gtat.me/about/ - Balzac, simple and clean (blog focused)
* http://dzerviniks.com/ - clean, big picture at top. Could be used for general sites though blog-focused.
* https://mmistakes.github.io/skinny-bones-jekyll/ - a lot of space. not sure about layout of subpages.
* http://ojs.xyz/solid-jekyll/ - bootstrap 3 theme too
